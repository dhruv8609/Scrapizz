# Web_Scraping
Web scraping is about downloading structured data from the web, selecting some of that data, and passing along what you selected to another process. There are plenty of libraries and python tools to implement these automation to data collecting tasks.

I've used Scrapy, Beautiful Soup and urllib3 in this repository.

Refer : [**Scrapy**](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) and [**Beautiful Soup**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/beautiful_soup/index.htm)
